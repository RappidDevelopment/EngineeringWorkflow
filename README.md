# RappidDev's Engineering Workflow
Website: [rappiddevelopment.com](http://rappiddevelopment.com)

## Purpose 
Here at Rappid Development headquarters, we mainly use GitHub, JIRA and Jenkins to help us to build software. We try to be as collaborative as possible and sometimes, keeping business stakeholders, product owners, developers, and testers all in sync during the software development lifecycle can be a tough task.  

We have deeply integrated these tools togther to bring all parts into one streamlined process. Issues in JIRA are automatically updated and transitioned based on a developer's work in Git and JIRA understands all branches, commits, pull requests and build/deployment statuses. Every issue is kept up to speed automatically, and developers, code reviewers, testers and business stakeholders can easily tack core code changes, build statuses and prior pull requests. This ensures smooth handoffds between engineers and leads to better results, delievery times and higher quality software. 

This document outlines that process and can act as a reference for all team members.
